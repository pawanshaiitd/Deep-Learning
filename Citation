The implementation is deeply inspired from Deep3d paper from (Xie et al,2016) and uses portions of their code for our implementation 
of 2d to 3d conversion from a tennis match video.

The resulting output 3d video in anaglyph format is present in the folder "output-tennis.avi". 

The training models are too big to put in along with the code.
